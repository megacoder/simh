Autocoder+IOCS.tap

This is a version of Autocoder that includes IOCS macros.  I don't know how
many updates have been applied.  It is set up to return to the 1410 operating
system at the end of the run: It prints "SWITCH TO 1410 MODE, RESET  START" at
the end.  Remember, the 1410 had a switch that let it run 1401 programs
natively.  I think it's set up for SimH traditional encoding.  I got this from
Paul Pierce.

Autocoder.Weaver.tap

This is a version of Autocoder that incorporates eleven update letters, plus a
custom modification to print the A- and B-address fields of instructions in
decimal as well as machine form.  It has a few macros, but no IOCS.  I think
it's set up for SimH traditional encoding.  I got this from Dick Weaver.

To run Autocoder in simh:

at mt1 autocoder
at mt4 scratch.mt4
at mt5 scratch.mt5
at mt6 scratch.mt6
at cdr source
at cdp object
at lpt listing
b mt1

where "autocoder" is one of the Autocoder tapes, "source" is your source code,
"object" is the file to which the object deck will be "punched" and "listing"
is the file to which the listing will be "printed".  For more information on
operating Autocoder, refer to 
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/14xx/C24-3319-0_1401_tapeAutocod.pdf.

When you're done, you can delete the three scratch tape files.

Fortran_v3m0.tap

This is Version 3, modification 0 of Fortran 1401-FO-050, a pre-Fortran-II
Fortran, not Fortran IV.  I think it's set up for SimH traditional encoding.  I
got this from Al Kossow.

Fortran_v3m4.tap

This is Version 3, modification 4 of Fortran 1401-FO-050, a pre-Fortran-II
Fortran, not Fortran IV.  I think it's set up for SimH traditional encoding.  I
got this from Paul Pierce.

To run Fortran in simh:

at mt1 fortran
at cdr deck
at lpt listing
at cdp object     if object deck is to be punched (see "control card" below)
b mt1
Set up to run the program -- sense switches, tapes, ....
g                 to run the program

where "fortran" is one of the Fortran tapes, "deck" is a control card
(described below) followed by the source code, optionally followed by a card
with a 5-8 punch in column 1 and then data, "listing" is the file to contain
the program listing, and "object" is the file to contain the object deck.

The control card has

1-5   PARAM - this field identifies the control card
6-8   maximum machine address the compiler and object program are to use, e.g.
      I9Z for 8k, I9R for 12k, I9I for 16k
9-10  Fixed-point modulus (number of digits) k = 01 ... 20.  Blank means k=5.
11-12 Floating-point mantissa length (number of digits) f = 02 ... 20.  Blank
      means f = 8.
13    P, if condensed deck is desired, blank if not.
14    S, if storage snapshot is desired, blank if not.
15    T, if processing on the IBM 1410 in 1401 compatibility mode.
16    X, if no format routine is desired
      L, if the limited format routine (READ TAPE, WRITE TAPE operations only)
         is desired
      b (blank), if the ordinary format routine is to be used
      A, if the A-conversion format routine is to be added to the ordinary
         format routine.  The A must be punched for A-conversion to operate
         correctly.
